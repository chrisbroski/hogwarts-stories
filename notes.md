## Character

Need a magic type (muggle, wizard, witch) for parents. Maybe it's a cultural thing like *Englishman*?

Siblings.

## Home Locations

There are several towns: Hogsmead, Godrick's Hollow, etc.

Wizards can also live in or around any city: London, etc.

Some may like natural surroundings. Herbologists and other farmers, those who study or work with magical creatures.

Others may live a traveling life: musicians, entertainers, merchants, travel writers, or just hippie types. In fancier versions of the camping tents from GoF and DH.

Do wizards have resorts? Vacation spots for festivals, beaches,

Combined with career, family size, and wealth, this should give a good multi-dimensional family setting.

## Experience

You gain experience in the 12 specific attributes when tasks that utilize that attribute are performed. At the end of each semester the experience earned in each one determines the permanent increase that attribute.

There is a also general experience. This is spread evenly across all stats. General XP is gained by working toward personal goals, even if that goal is improving a specific attribute. For example, if a character wants to become brave, then taking a risk (like eating a Bertie Bott's bean) that would earn anyone a determination point, would also earn that character a general point.
