The other rooms accessible in this parent location should be listed as a series of buttons at the end of this description.

Things in the room could be listed floating links along the right side of the text, maybe. The standard thing to do when clicked on would be to give a description of it. Items have many common actions: pick up and carry, a book or newspaper could be read, food could be eaten, a mini-game could be initiated, experience could be granted, etc. which I suppose would be links listed after the description.

For example, this location is your home. Rooms could be your bedroom, the living room, kitchen, and back yard.

### End Buttons

Floating links are dumb. End buttons make more sense and I think they could work for all situations.
